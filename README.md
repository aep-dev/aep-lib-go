# aep-lib-go

This repository contains utility libraries that are common across the other aep go-based tools (e.g. aepcli, aepc, terraform-provider-aep).

It contains, among other things:

- common utilities for case conversion
- a service definition that can be extracted from aep-compliant or close to aep-compliant openapi specifications.
- a writer for compliant OpenAPI specifications.

For usage of individual packages, please see the tests.
